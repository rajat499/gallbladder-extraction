# gallbladder-extraction
Gallbladder extraction from an ultrsound image using classical image processing techniques developed during [COL780](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~chetan/teaching/col780-2020.html)

It uses Gaussian Blur, adaptive gaussian & otsu thresholding, and contour detection. The entire pipeline is explained in detail in the [report](./final_report.pdf).
